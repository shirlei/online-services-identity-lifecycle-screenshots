### Create account

*Steps performed via web browser.*

1 - Access to initial page ([1-instagram-create-account.png](./create/1-instagram-create-account.png)).

2 - Fill up the signup form ([2-instagram-create-account.png](./create/2-instagram-create-account.png)).

3 - Add birthday ([3-instagram-create-account.png](./create/3-instagram-create-account.png)).

4 - Inform confirmation code sent to your email ([4-instagram-create-account.png](./create/4-instagram-create-account.png)).

After the four initial steps, supposedly, you should have access to your newly created account.

During this process, I had to go back (hitting the 'go back' option) during step 4 because I realised I had incorrectly typed my email... So when I got back to step 4, informed the confirmation code sent to the right address, and hit next, the next page ([5-instagram-create-account.png](./create/5-instagram-create-account.png)) showed me that my account was suspended. It has fallen into some sort of suspicious activity, and so to complete the account creation and have access to the account, I had to perform more verification steps (email and SMS codes), as shown in images 6 to 9.
